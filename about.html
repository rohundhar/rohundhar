	<p>I’m currently a senior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Japanese. I am a programmer, teacher, designer, musician, and board game enthusiast. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan(truthfully, the “greater Detroit area”), where I attended Detroit Country Day School and began my journey with courses for both Java and Japanese. During this time, I also wrote, directed, and performed a musical street-play, Sachi Baath(roughly translating to “Real Talk", to address the crisis of child sexual abuse in communities across India. <br></br>

	Earlier this year, I worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.dglab.com/en/">Digital Garage</a> in Tokyo, Japan and, the year before that, with <a href="https://www.altimetrik.com/#!/">Altimetrik</a>. Two very different coding and team experiences which have been very influential in my professional development. My time at Digital Garage was mostly spent working jointly with <a href="https://blockstream.com/">Blockstream</a>, a leader in blockchain technology, to create a working points-exchange system schedule for Japanese release as well as extending the Bitcoin Protocol ; It was my first exposure to blockchain technology, and doubling up with my role as a translator was a gratifying combination of my fields of study! I also have been a program coordinator at South End Technology Center(<a href="http://www.tech-center-enlightentcity.tv/">SETC</a>) in Boston since 2015 developing curricula for middle school through high school students for Arduino programming. <br></br>

	I’ve been an active musician for almost 15 years, and think of myself as a creative problem solver, whether it relate to music or machines. Throughout my time at Tufts, I’ve become familiar with a bunch of cool(I think) technologies such as web programming, cryptocurrency, game development, machine learning, computer architecture, and many more. <br></br>

	In my spare time, I like to read, play video games, eat, cook, and order food. I am currently living in Somerville, Massachussetts.
