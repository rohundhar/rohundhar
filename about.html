	<p id="bio">I’m currently a senior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Japanese. I am a programmer, teacher, designer, musician, and board game enthusiast. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan(truthfully, the “greater Detroit area”), where I attended Detroit Country Day School and began my journey with courses for both Java and Japanese. During this time, I also wrote, directed, and performed a musical street-play, Sachi Baath(roughly translating to “Real Talk", to address the crisis of child sexual abuse in communities across India. Sachi Baath is an active organization, with binannual performances in the greater Mumbai Area. <br></br>

	Earlier this year, I worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.dglab.com/en/" target="_blank" style="color:white;">Digital Garage</a> in Tokyo, Japan and, the year before that, with <a href="https://www.altimetrik.com/#!/" target="_blank" style="color:white;">Altimetrik</a>. Two very different coding and team experiences which have been very influential in my professional development. My time at Digital Garage was mostly spent working jointly with <a href="https://blockstream.com/"  target="_blank" style="color:white;">Blockstream</a>, a leader in blockchain technology, to create a working points-exchange system schedule for Japanese release as well as extending the Bitcoin Protocol ; It was my first exposure to blockchain technology, and doubling up with my role as a translator was a gratifying combination of my fields of study! I also have been a program coordinator at South End Technology Center(<a href="http://www.tech-center-enlightentcity.tv/"  target="_blank" style="color:white;">SETC</a>) in Boston since 2015 developing curricula for middle school through high school students for Arduino programming. <br></br>

	I’ve been an active musician for almost 15 years, and think of myself as a creative problem solver, whether it relates to music or machines. This love of problem-solving led me to entrepreneurship at a young age, starting in high school with the South Asian Sibs, a mentorship program I founded to connect South Asian youth with South Asian college undergraduates in order to accelerate personal and professional growth.  Another entreupreneurial endeavor is The Carnival, a (now disbanded) company which played out as an "Angie's List" for people seeking out talented artists, as performers and teachers.<br></br>

	Throughout my time at Tufts, I’ve become familiar with a bunch of cool(I think) technologies such as web programming, cryptocurrency, game development, machine learning, computer architecture, and many more. <br></br>

	In my spare time, I like to read, play video games, eat, cook, and order food. I am currently living in Somerville, Massachussetts.
