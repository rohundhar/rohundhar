MY PERSONAL WEBSITE

THIS REPOSITORY ACTS AS THE CONTENT AND STYLE FOR MY PERSONAL WEBSITE, FOUND AT "WWW.ROHUNDHAR.GITHUB.IO". THIS WEBSITE CAN ALSO BE ACCESSED THROUGH "WWW.CS.TUFTS.EDU/~RDHAR02" BECAUSE OF AN IMPLEMENTED REDIRECTION. 

THE MAIN PAGE OF MY WEBSITE, INDEX.HTML, IS THE FIRST DISPLAYED PAGE. THE PAGE DISPLAYS MY NAME, A RECENT PHOTO, A LINK TO MY PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY(BIO.HTML), AND A LINK TO AN UPDATED RESUME(RESUME.HTML). THE STYLING FOR ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT .HTML FILES IS DEFINED IN THE .CSS FILE OF THE SAME NAME. ALL .CSS AND .HTML FILES HAVE PASSED OFFICIAL HTML5 SPECIFICATIONS AS VALIDATED BY W3.ORG. 

I DID NOT COLLABORATE WITH ANYONE ON THIS ASSIGNMENT, AND SPENT APPROXIMATELY FIVE HOURS WORKING.
